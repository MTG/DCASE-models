Extending the library
=====================

This section includes clear instructions on how to extend different components of `DCASE-models`.

Datasets
--------

Each dataset is implemented in the library as a class that inherits from _Dataset.

To include a new dataset in the library you should do this and that.


Features
--------

Feature representations are implemented as specializations of the base class _FeatureExtractor.

In order to implement a new feature you should write a class that inherits from _FeatureExtractor.

The methods you should reimplement are: 
 - this method
 - the other one


Models
------

Say something about including new models.
