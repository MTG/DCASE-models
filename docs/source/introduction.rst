Introduction
============

`DCASE-models`  is an open-source Python library for rapid prototyping 
of environmental sound analysis systems, with an emphasis on deep--learning models. 
The project is on `GitHub`_.

It's main features / design goals are:

* ease of use,
* rapid prototyping of environmental sound analysis systems,
* a simple and lightweight set of basic components that are generally part of a computational environmental audio analysis system,
* a collection of functions for dataset handling, data preparation, feature extraction, and evaluation (most of which rely on existing tools),
* a model interface to standardize the interaction of machine learning methods with the other system components,
* an abstraction layer to make the library independent of the backend used to implement the machine learning model,
* inclusion of reference implementations for several state-of-the-art algorithms.

`DCASE-models` is a work in progress, thus input is always welcome.

The available documentation is limited for now, but :ref:`you can help to
improve it <write_documentation>`.
